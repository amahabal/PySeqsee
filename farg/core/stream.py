  """Implements the Stream of Thought.

     The main public function here is FocusOn(), called with::

       stream.FocusOn(focusable)

     where focusable must be an instance of the interface FocusableMixin. FocusableMixin
     defines three methods: GetFringe(), GetAffordances(), and GetSimilarityAffordances().

     The net effect of the call to FocusOn is to influence future processing in two ways:

       * By adding codelets, as described below.
       * By modifying the context in which future FocusOn()s work. This is implicit in the
         description of GetSimilarityAffordances() below.

     A blow-by-blow account of what happens:

       * The fringe of the focusable is obtained via a call to GetFringe().
       * If this fringe overlaps a prior stored fringe sufficiently,
         GetSimilarityAffordances() is called on the prior focusable and can create codelets,
         but not just yet add these to the coderack.
       * GetAffordances() may generate more codelets that haven't yet been added.
       * Of these potential codelets, about 2 are chosen (biased by urgency) for addition to
         the coderack.
